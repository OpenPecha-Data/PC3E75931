The Noble Essence of Dependent Origination

from the Words of the Buddha

In the language of India: Ārya-pratītyasamutpāda-hṛdaya-nāmaIn the language of Tibet: 'phags
pa rten cing 'brel par 'byung ba'i snying poIn the English language: The Essence of Dependent
Origination

Homage to the Buddha, the Blessed One!

All phenomena that originate from causes,The Tathāgata has taught these causes,And also that
which puts a stop to these causes,This too has been taught by the Great Śramaṇa.

ye dharmā hetu prabhavā hetun teṣāṃ tathāgato hy avadatteṣāṃ ca yo nirodha evaṃ vādī mahāśramaṇaḥ


Reciting this essence once will purify all misdeeds and pacify and avert all forms of adversity.
An object that is focused upon while reciting this will become a form of the buddha or
a support of veneration. An offering that is focused upon while reciting this will become
the equivalent of a gift that fills the entire world.

This concludes the Essence of Dependent Origination.
